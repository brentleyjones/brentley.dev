It's been over 5 years since my last post on [brentleyjones.com](https://brentleyjones.com) (which will soon redirect here, [brentley.dev](https://brentley.dev), as I've moved those posts over). I also only posted for the span of two weeks.

I have a couple theories on why my first blogging attempt failed so quickly, and why I haven't tried again until now. My main theory is that I was expecting too much of myself, which lead to me not even trying. Besides for having lower expectations of myself now (üòâ), I'm also going to try to focus on short posts that heavily reference other works if they exist. For example, as a test run I wrote [Using Homebrew on Apple Silicon (M1) Macs](2020-12-15-Homebrew-on-M1.md). So, hopefully this time works out better üòÖ.

Anyway, how about an update? In the last 5 years I've moved (but still in Minneapolis), had a couple kids (and foster kids), changed jobs numerous times (Target ‚û°Ô∏è Charles Schwab ‚û°Ô∏è Consulting ‚û°Ô∏è RedBrick Health ‚û°Ô∏è Target ‚û°Ô∏è Lyft), and started to focus on client tooling (build systems and developer tools) over app development. I still like TTRPGs (Pathfinder 2e is pretty neat) and TV/movies (‚ù§Ô∏è The Magicians).

Since my job recently changed to officially focus on client tooling, I have a feeling the topic of my posts will revolve around that. So, if you like learning about [Bazel](https://bazel.build), how the Swift build system works, or the various ways one can abuse Xcode, then check back later (or better yet, subscribe to the [Atom Feed](/atom.xml)).
